<p><strong>Interview Transcript</strong></p>
<p>What is your name and occupation?</p>
<p>My name is Ryan LaDue, and I am a vocational nurse here at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>Can you tell us a little bit about your day to day schedule?</p>
<p>Right now, I have taken on an assistant manager role a couple of years ago. So, I did a lot of floor nursing before this, but now I am more into management. We have a team of 12 MAs, 5 LVNs, and around 15 or 16 providers working for us right now over in our department. So right now I fill in depending on who is out. I have been here for about 8 years, so I fill in if  someone is out sick. For instance, if the referral coordinator is out, or if I have an office nurse out, or an MA out I fill into all those different roles and do a lot of scheduling. Things like that. Problem solving. </p>
<p>Are you currently fully staffed or are you looking for more nurses?</p>
<p>Right now we are not fully staffed. We are fully staffed on the nursing staff, but we are short on some of the MAs right now. We are gonna be hiring over the summer time.</p>
<p>Can you tell us what your educational path looked like? Majors? Minors? Where you went to nursing school?</p>
<p>I went to nursing school in upstate New York, it’s where I’m from. I have done a lot of different things and ended up in nursing a roundabout way. I started from the bottom as a phlebotomist, then I did a certified nursing aide in nursing homes. I was also a medical assistant in a clinic and a clinical assistant, then a I had worked up to an LVN. I worked in a lot of of different aspects of healthcare. Most of my education took place in New York. I’m actually still taking classes here in Texas and I’m slowly working up to different things.</p>
<p>What is the end goal for you?</p>
<p>That’s a great question. I think I just want to end with my BSN.</p>
<p>Did you start off not knowing you wanted to be a nurse? How did that process go for you?</p>
<p>That's correct. I started in an a-traditional way. I didn't go right out of high school to college like most people. I worked in the field and I was always told there was a perception that nursing was too complicated and too hard to get through the school and difficult to get in, and I thought it was too difficult at the time, 10 years ago. Then, I started to work more in the healthcare field and I got little certifications, so like I said I was doing phlebotomy, I was a clinical assistant, a certified nurse’s aide. Slowly as I started to work in healthcare, work with other nurses, I would think “I think this is something I could actually, probably do.” I had gotten a scholarship up in New York where they gave me my LVN for free. New York has a lot of really great programs for that. I had moved down here to Texas and I have slowly gone to school part time as I’ve been working here full time. </p>
<p>What drew you to this career field?</p>
<p>I had worked other jobs outside of healthcare when I was younger, a lot of those jobs were working on commision, trying to get money out of people, so it didn't really feel like the most honest job to me. I loved healthcare because I don’t feel like I’m getting money out of people, that’s not the goal like a lot of jobs that you end up having. I just get to come to work and I get to help people to the best of my abilities, it's a very honest job.</p>
<p>What would you say is your biggest challenge in your job? </p>
<p>The biggest challenge in my job currently is making sure we are fully staffed, The U.S. is just short on nurses to begin with, getting people in, but also dealing with insurance companies I find to be the most difficult because I can have three different people with three different insurances with the same problem and they all get treated a little different based on, not how the doctor treats them, but medicines and things like that. I find that the most challenging and frustrating to deal with. </p>
<p>What was the biggest thing you had to overcome to get where you are today?<p/>
<p>For me, which is probably different than other people, I have always worked full time. So I work about 45-50 hours a week and I go to school in the evenings, so just being able to find the hours in the day to get all those things done is probably my biggest challenge. Days are long enough, and you want to give 100% to everything, and you have to sleep too. It gets challenging when you get really busy times at work and really busy times at school too. It never seems perfectly aligned or balanced.</p>
<p>What do you see as the future of healthcare?</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>What do you think is the most rewarding part of your job?</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Non-science related, what are the most important interpersonal skills a nurse/physician should possess?</p>
<p>I think what’s most important is that you have to make the patient feel comfortable. A lot of times people are coming in sick and can feel a little bit helpless. You have to make them feel comfortable and make them feel like you are here to help them. Maybe, help calm their nerves. That could be a little bit challenging especially when you first get into the field, you also have to put forward that you know what you’re doing. You need to have your confidence. But also, be prepared and know what you’re doing. When you first get into the field that is a difficult skill to get because you have a lot of first times. </p>
<p>Reflection</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Louis Tonnel and I’ll be reflecting on the interview.The first thing that marked me was that I really liked what he said about wanting a job where you’re not going for money and rather just helping people to the best of your ability and that being your reward and not making money off of commissions for example, like the jobs he said he used to work. It was very refreshing to hear that. The second thing that marked me was what he said about web booking and efficiency. Apparently he sort of misses the old way of booking appointments by phone rather than the system today that involves making online reservations. That was pretty surprising to me. The last thing I’d like to reflect on was what he said about patient and healthcare provider interactions. I really enjoyed what he said about making them comfortable, letting them know you know what you’re doing, that you’re confident, and that you’ll take good care of them, and that the most important thing is to make them feel at ease and comfortable with you providing them with a healthcare service.
