<p>Reflection</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Louis Tonnel and I’ll be reflecting on the interview.The first thing that marked me was that I really liked what he said about wanting a job where you’re not going for money and rather just helping people to the best of your ability and that being your reward and not making money off of commissions for example, like the jobs he said he used to work. It was very refreshing to hear that. The second thing that marked me was what he said about web booking and efficiency. Apparently he sort of misses the old way of booking appointments by phone rather than the system today that involves making online reservations. That was pretty surprising to me. The last thing I’d like to reflect on was what he said about patient and healthcare provider interactions. I really enjoyed what he said about making them comfortable, letting them know you know what you’re doing, that you’re confident, and that you’ll take good care of them, and that the most important thing is to make them feel at ease and comfortable with you providing them with a healthcare service.
