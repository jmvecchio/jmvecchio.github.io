<p><strong>Interview Transcript</strong></p>
<p>What is your name and occupation?</p>
<p>My name is Ryan LaDue, and I am a vocational nurse here at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>Can you tell us a little bit about your day to day schedule?</p>
<p>Right now, I have taken on an assistant manager role a couple of years ago. So, I did a lot of floor nursing before this, but now I am more into management. We have a team of 12 MAs, 5 LVNs, and around 15 or 16 providers working for us right now over in our department. So right now I fill in depending on who is out. I have been here for about 8 years, so I fill in if  someone is out sick. For instance, if the referral coordinator is out, or if I have an office nurse out, or an MA out I fill into all those different roles and do a lot of scheduling. Things like that. Problem solving. </p>
<p>Are you currently fully staffed or are you looking for more nurses?</p>
<p>Right now we are not fully staffed. We are fully staffed on the nursing staff, but we are short on some of the MAs right now. We are gonna be hiring over the summer time.</p>
<p>Can you tell us what your educational path looked like? Majors? Minors? Where you went to nursing school?</p>
<p>I went to nursing school in upstate New York, it’s where I’m from. I have done a lot of different things and ended up in nursing a roundabout way. I started from the bottom as a phlebotomist, then I did a certified nursing aide in nursing homes. I was also a medical assistant in a clinic and a clinical assistant, then a I had worked up to an LVN. I worked in a lot of of different aspects of healthcare. Most of my education took place in New York. I’m actually still taking classes here in Texas and I’m slowly working up to different things.</p>
<p>What is the end goal for you?</p>
<p>That’s a great question. I think I just want to end with my BSN.</p>
<p>Did you start off not knowing you wanted to be a nurse? How did that process go for you?</p>
<p>What drew you to this career field?</p>
<p>What would you say is your biggest challenge in your job? </p>
<p>What was the biggest thing you had to overcome to get where you are today?<p/>
<p>What do you see as the future of healthcare?</p>
<p>What do you think is the most rewarding part of your job?</p>
<p>Do you have any advice for current undergraduate students like us who are interested in the biology field?</p>
<p>Non-science related, what are the most important interpersonal skills a nurse/physician should possess?</p>
<p>Reflection</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Louis Tonnel and I’ll be reflecting on the interview.The first thing that marked me was that I really liked what he said about wanting a job where you’re not going for money and rather just helping people to the best of your ability and that being your reward and not making money off of commissions for example, like the jobs he said he used to work. It was very refreshing to hear that. The second thing that marked me was what he said about web booking and efficiency. Apparently he sort of misses the old way of booking appointments by phone rather than the system today that involves making online reservations. That was pretty surprising to me. The last thing I’d like to reflect on was what he said about patient and healthcare provider interactions. I really enjoyed what he said about making them comfortable, letting them know you know what you’re doing, that you’re confident, and that you’ll take good care of them, and that the most important thing is to make them feel at ease and comfortable with you providing them with a healthcare service.
